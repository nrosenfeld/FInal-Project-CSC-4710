# FInal-Project-CSC-4710

The files contain the source code for the website https://wsuproject4.000webhostapp.com/ 

This website was created as the final project for CSC 4710 and was completed as a group project. The names of the website creators are: Nathan Rosenfeld, Mikayla Scott, Kristopher
Covert, Bryan Wioncek and Tyler Groat.

The website allows the user to enter tasks with a due date. The main screen displays the tasks due that day and the ones already completed.
The user has the option to select a display of tasks completed that week, the previous week, or 2 weeks prior. The user can also change the names of categories and create new
categories.

The website was created as the culmination of a database course, and its purpose is to demonstrate knowledge of SQL and PHP. Clearly, there are functional and security deficiencies 
which would make the website inadvisable for practical use.
